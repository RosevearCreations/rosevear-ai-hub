## Operator setup

After this build reaches the local Hub, open the Hub once and create the first owner account. Use a username of at least 3 characters and a password of at least 12 characters.

No GitHub secret, OAuth application, cloud account, or paid service is required.

## External setup

No external application, API key, OAuth registration, hosted database, secret, or paid service is
required for Build 017.

The registry is local metadata and administration only. Tool execution remains unavailable until
the confirmation workflow is introduced.

- [x] final Build 018 dev CI green
- [x] promoted to main
- [x] final Build 018 main CI green
- [x] dev synchronized with main

## External setup

No external application, API key, OAuth registration, hosted database, secret, or paid service is
required for Build 018.

The confirmation workflow is local Hub state. The default five-minute expiry may be adjusted with
`CONFIRMATION_TTL_SECONDS` if needed.

## Build 019 acceptance checklist

- [x] authorization/cookie/credential/private-key redaction
- [x] Bearer/Basic value redaction
- [x] bounded string/depth/collection payloads
- [x] reversible audit schema migration
- [x] historical audit backfill coverage
- [x] backend audit policy/filter/sanitization tests
- [x] authenticated web audit coverage
- [x] Windows/Tauri packaging passed on implementation tree
- [x] security/data-model/build documentation
- [x] no external logging service, secret, or paid dependency required
- [ ] final Build 019 dev CI green
- [ ] promoted to main
- [ ] final Build 019 main CI green
- [ ] dev synchronized with main

## External setup

No external logging service, API key, OAuth application, cloud account, secret, hosted database, or
paid subscription is required for Build 019.

Audit data remains local in the Hub database. Build 019 does not automatically prune audit rows;
the documented 180-day retention target remains an operational target until backup/retention
automation is introduced deliberately.
